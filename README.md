Liar’s Dice 로직

1.	플레이어들이 방에 입장한다.
2.	제일 먼저들어온 사람을 방장으로 정하고 방장이 스타트 버튼을 누르면 게임을 시작한다.
3.	턴은 방장부터 시작되어 들어온 순서대로 턴을 진행한다.
4.	첫번째 턴의 플레이어는 자기의 턴에 1~6 사이의 숫자가 n 개이상이라고 제출한다.
5.	그 이후의 플레이어는 1~6 사이의 숫사가 n+1 개 이상이라고 제출하거나 이전 플레이어의 주장이 거짓이라고 이야기할 수 있다.
6.	만약 결과를 확인했는데, 거짓이면 이전 플레이어가 참이라면 플레이어가 패배 한다.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
